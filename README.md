##**Firmware for q282 hexacopter ( rate / angle )**


###Radio protocol:
Current options are H8 mini transmitter / devo, cg023 transmitter , CX-10 (later "blue" variant) and H7. Protocol is by default H8 mini protocol, and can be changed in file config.h

###Accelerometer calibration:
Move the pitch stick down 3 times within about 2 seconds. Needs to be done on a level surface. Saved so it only needs to be done once. You may need to use high rates in order to reach the treshold.

###Installation and Support
Currently this port is covered by the it's own thread on rcgroups.
